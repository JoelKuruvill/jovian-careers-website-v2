## Overview
A project created following a [course by freeCodeCamp and Jovian](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/develop-database-driven-web-apps-with-python-flask-and-mysql/), so that I may learn and work with the Flask framework. The website is delpyed and accessible here: https://jovian-careers-website-594h.onrender.com.

## Developer Development Notes
Step 1 - completed.
Step 2 - completed.
Step 3 - completed.
Step 4 - In progress, at about 1hr42mins.
  - Flask Template tags == React props.
  - The 'end+for/if', indicates end of a template tag code block.
